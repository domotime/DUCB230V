| `FORCE M1` | This menu entry is only available for installations with Electromechanical motors. <br><br>**FORCE M1** (from 40% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of motor force M1** (swing gate) to ensure correct movement of the gate leaf.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. After installation, check that the safety regulations in force are complied with the set value (*). If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). <br><br>NOTE: A change in this parameter will require reinstallation of the control unit. |
| `FORCE M2` | This menu entry is only available for installations with Electromechanical motors. <br><br>**FORCE M2** (from 40% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of motor force M2** (swing gate) to ensure correct movement of the gate leaf.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. After installation, check that the safety regulations in force are complied with the set value (*). If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). <br><br>NOTE: A change in this parameter will require reinstallation of the control unit. |
| `SENSITIVITY M1` | This menu entry is only available for installations with Electromechanical motors.<br><br> **SENSITIVITY M1** (from 0% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of obstacle sensitivity for motor M1**. <br>The higher the value, the greater the sensitivity to obstacle detection.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. Ensure that the set value complies with the current safety regulations (*). <br>If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). <br><br>This parameter is also known as *obstacle sensor* or *amperometric*. |
| `SENSITIVITY M2` | This menu entry is only available for installations with Electromechanical motors.<br><br> **SENSITIVITY M2** (from 0% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of obstacle sensitivity for motor M2**. <br>The higher the value, the greater the sensitivity to obstacle detection.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. Ensure that the set value complies with the current safety regulations (*). <br>If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). <br><br>This parameter is also known as *obstacle sensor* or *amperometric*. |
| `SLOWDOWN SENS M1` | This menu entry is only available for versions 1.3.6 or later.<br><br> **SENSITIVITY IN SLOWDOWN M1** (from 0% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of obstacle sensitivity** for motor M1 during slowdown. The higher the value, the greater the sensitivity to obstacle detection.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. Ensure that the set value complies with the current safety regulations (*). If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). |
| `SLOWDOWN SENS M2` | This menu entry is only available for versions 1.3.6 or later.<br><br> **SENSITIVITY IN SLOWDOWN M2** (from 0% to 100%): <br>**Adjustment of obstacle sensitivity** for motor M2 during slowdown. The higher the value, the greater the sensitivity to obstacle detection.<br><br>WARNING! This parameter directly affects the impact force. Ensure that the set value complies with the current safety regulations (*). If necessary, install anti-crush safety devices (**). |
| `WORK TIME M1` |  This menu entry is only available for installations with Hydraulic motors.<br><br> **WORK TIME M1** (from 0s to 60s):<br>**Manual adjustment of work time** taken by motor M1 to perform a full open/close maneuver.<br><br>NOTE: for installations with electromechanical motors, work time is auto-adjusted during the installation phase and reported as additional information in the INFO menu. |
| `WORK TIME M2` |  This menu entry is only available for installations with Hydraulic motors.<br><br> **WORK TIME M2** (from 0s to 60s):<br>**Manual adjustment of work time** taken by motor M2 to perform a full open/close maneuver.<br><br>NOTE: for installations with electromechanical motors, work time is auto-adjusted during the installation phase and reported as additional information in the INFO menu. |
| `OPENING DELAY M2` | **OPENING DELAY FOR M2** (from 0s to 15s):<br> Defines the delay between the two gate leaves during the opening phase to avoid their overlapping.<br><br>In opening, the M2 leaf (fixed) moves later compared to the M1 leaf (swing) according to the set time. At 0s the delay is disabled. |
| `PARTIAL OPEN 50%` | **PARTIAL OPENING** (from 25% to 100%): <br>Partial opening is a movement that can only be activated from a completely closed gate; it allows the opening of only the M1 leaf (swing) according to the set percentage. |
