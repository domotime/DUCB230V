| `MOT - NMOT - FCA - FCC` | SYSTEM INFO:<br>**EL**: Electromechanical **OL**: Hydraulic **N**: Absent **Y**: Present |
| `TEMPO LAVORO M1` | This menu item is available only for systems with Electromechanical motors.<br><br>**WORK TIME M1**: <br>Time taken by motor M1 to perform a complete opening/closing cycle.<br><br>NOTE: With the control unit not installed, the work time is set to the maximum value of 60 seconds. |
| `TEMPO LAVORO M2` | This menu item is available only for systems with Electromechanical motors.<br><br>**WORK TIME M2**: <br>Time taken by motor M2 to perform a complete opening/closing cycle.<br><br>NOTE: With the control unit not installed, the work time is set to the maximum value of 60 seconds. |
| `NUM. MANOVRE` | **NUMBER OF MANEUVERS**: <br>Counter of the number of maneuvers (openings/closures) performed during the entire life cycle of the control unit. |
| `STP FOT1 FOT2 SC` | **INPUT TEST**: <br>Allows checking the correct functioning of the inputs.<br><br>The name associated with the input starts flashing when it is in an unrest state (for example, a normally closed (NC) contact flashes if it is open). |
| `FCA1 FCC1 FCA2 FCC2` | **END-OF-TRAVEL INPUT TEST**: <br>Allows checking the correct functioning of the end-of-travel inputs.<br><br>The name associated with the input starts flashing when it is in an unrest state (for example, a normally closed (NC) contact flashes if it is open).<br><br>NOTE: Inputs can only be tested in the presence of the optional module for end-of-travel. |
